		 <pre>
 mkdir -p $JLAB_ROOT/1.3.1
		 </pre>
		 
		 Set the environment variables. You should have these lines in your login script:
		 
		 <pre>
 setenv JLAB_ROOT /opt/jlab_software
 source $JLAB_ROOT/1.3.1/ce/jlab.csh
		 </pre>
		 

	 </li>
	 
	 
	 
	 <li>Get the installation scripts:
		 <pre>
 cd $JLAB_ROOT
 wget http://www.jlab.org/12gev_phys/packages/sources/ceInstall/ceInstall_1.3.1.tar.gz
 tar -zxpvf ceInstall_1.3.1.tar.gz
		 </pre>
		 
	 </li>

	 If you do, great. You're ready to run the patch installation script.<br>
	 Notice: if you already have some existing environment variable that you want to keep,
	 use the option "keepmine":<br>
	 <pre>
 source $JLAB_ROOT/1.3.1/ce/jlab.csh keepmine
	 </pre>
	 
	 
	 <li>
		 Choose the packages you wish to install by executing the corresponding script:
		 <pre>
 cd $JLAB_ROOT/1.3.1

 ./go_patch.
		 </pre>
	
	This will make symbolic links to the 1.3 packages except for the gemc package, which is now at version 2.4 and is installed from source.
