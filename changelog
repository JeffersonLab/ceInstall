TO RELEASE:

- change release date in ce/jlab scripts
- change default JLAB_VERSION in jlab.csh and jlab.sh
- make sure versions.env is updated
- for ceInstall and mlibrary: use local go_tar option before making the git release
- make new releases as needed, remember to update changelog. Notice, deleting a release is not enough: need to delete the tag also.
- test installation, copy initial log in sbsInstall/template_install.html


NOTES:

- go_tar ceInstall will generate the _install.html based on the release number
- for JLAB interactive farm. Usually it cannot access the outside web, but setting these bypass this:

  a. setenv http_proxy http://jprox.jlab.org:8082
  b. setenv https_proxy http://jprox.jlab.org:8082

  For ROOT in particular one can also download these "src" and put them in the "dst".

  a. src1='http://lcgpackages.web.cern.ch/lcgpackages/tarFiles/sources/lz4-v1.7.5.tar.gz' to: dst1='/group/halla/analysis/rootbuild/ifarm1402/root-6.12.06/build/LZ4-prefix/src/lz4-v1.7.5.tar.gz'
  b. src2='http://lcgpackages.web.cern.ch/lcgpackages/tarFiles/sources/tbb2017_U5.tar.gz' to: dst2='/group/halla/analysis/rootbuild/ifarm1402/root-6.12.06/build/TBB-prefix/src/tbb2017_U5.tar.gz'

  2. by mass fraction. Example:
         Gas->AddMaterial(matman->FindOrBuildMaterial("G4_H"), 0.2);
