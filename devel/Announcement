Email Draft:

A new version of the production JLab software libraries is available:

Version 2.2 includes these updates:

- scons build:  1.5 > 1.6
- banks:        1.3 > 1.4
- ccdb:         stays 1.06.02
- clhep:        2.3.4.3 > 2.3.4.5
- evio:         stays 5.1
- geant4:       4.10.02.p03 > 4.10.03.p02

- jana:         stays 0.7.7p1
- mlibrary:     1.1 > 1.2
- qt:           5.8.0 > 5.9.1
- root:         6.08.04 >
- xercesc:      3.1.4 > 3.2.0

Starting from Wed, March 21 2018 the "production.csh" will require as a first argument the version. This will ensure that:

- changes in JLAB_VERSION will not change libraries version underneath users
- there's no ambiguity in what a version users are running.

The gcc and cmake versions requirements are dropped from the scripts as the CUE machines provide sufficient updated version of these by default.

The development version will upgrade to the latest version of all these packages.
This will not happen all at once, so bewhare of using development.


To setup the environment to use 2.2:

Csh:

source /site/12gev_phys/production.csh 2.2

Bash:

source /site/12gev_phys/production.sh 2.2
