TO RELEASE:

- change release date in jlab.csh
- make sure versions.env is updated
- change install.html

Email Draft:


A new version of the JLab software libraries is available.
This release adopts two critical changes:
- ROOT v6
- c++11 compiler: gcc 5.2

Because of this, it is a "major" release: 2.0

Version 2.0 includes these updates:

- clhep:        2.2.0.8 > 2.3.3.1
- QT:           5.3.2 > 5.6.0
- xercesc:      3.1.1 > 3.1.3
- geant4:       4.10.01.p03 > 4.10.02.p02
- gemc:         2.4  >  2.5
- JANA:         stays 0.7.4p2
- banks:        1,2 > 1.3
- build system: 1.3 > 1.4
- ROOT:         5.34.34 > 6.06
- EVIO:         4.4.4 > 5.1
- CCDB:         stays 1.06

The "production.csh" will require the version argument starting from Tuesday, Oct 11. This will ensure that:

- changes in JLAB_VERSION will not change libraries version underneath users
- there's no ambiguity in what a version users are running.


Details on what's in each version can be found here.

To setup the environment. Csh users:

source /site/12gev_phys/production.csh 2.0

Bash users:

source /site/12gev_phys/2.0/ce/jlab.sh
