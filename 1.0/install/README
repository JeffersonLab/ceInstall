 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

 1) Choose a place to install the software, and a JLAB_VERSION.
    Common choices are /opt/jlab_software and "production".

    Set the environment variable accordingly:
 
    setenv JLAB_ROOT /opt/jlab_software
    setenv JLAB_VERSION devel


 2) Get the installation scripts:
    
    cd $JLAB_ROOT
    wget http://www.jlab.org/12gev_phys/packages/sources/ceInstall/ceInstall_$JLAB_VERSION.tar.gz
    tar -zxpvf ceInstall_$JLAB_VERSION.tar.gz


 3) From now on you can use these lines to set up the environment. Remember to cleanup your login scripts
	to avoid conflicts.

    setenv JLAB_ROOT /opt/jlab_software
    setenv JLAB_VERSION devel
    source $JLAB_ROOT/$JLAB_VERSION/ce/jlab.csh

 4) Start a new shell. Now you should see a log similar to this:

   > Common Environment Version: <devel>  (Tue, 25 Feb 2014)
