Hi all,

I'm working on the JLAB_VERSION tag "devel". There are some significant changes:

1. use the new geant4
2. the new g4 requires a compiler version > what's present in CentOS7.7 so I picked the last one: version 9.2.0 in /apps
3. use python 3 as python 2 is being deprecated everywhere. Python 3 comes as default in all new OS.
4. use scons 3 for the same reason. scons 3 comes as default in all new OS.

Here's the list of changes:

gcc: 4.8.5 > 9.2.0
python: 2 to 3
scons 2 to 3
clhep: 2.4.1.3
geant4: 4.10.06, both in single and multithreaded mode
root 6.18.04
ccdb: 1.06 to 1.07

The big change is geant4, just released in December with a physics fix which is crucial for JLab experiments using A=2 or A=3 targets.


JLab Physics Software Libraries Release Announcement
----------------------------------------------------

Production tag 2.3 of the JLab Physics Software Libraries will be available on October 3, 2018. It includes these updates:

- banks:        stays 1.4
- ccdb:         stays 1.06.02
- clhep:        2.3.4.5 > 2.4.0.4
- evio:         stays 5.1
- geant4:       4.10.03.p02 > 4.10.04.p02
- gemc:         2.6 > 2.7
- jana:         0.7.7p1 > 0.8.0
- mlibrary:     1.2 > 1.3
- qt:           5.9.1 to system defaults (currently 5.10.1 on most systems)
- root:         6.12.06 > 6.14.04
- scons build:  1.6 > 1.7
- xercesc:      3.2.0 > 3.2.2

The "softenv" scripts are available to setup the environment, replacing the deprecated production scripts.

Version 2.3 comes with the possibility of selecting a subset of the supported libraries by
listing them in a ~/.jlab_software user file. For example, for geant4 only support, that file would read:

   clhep geant4 qt xercesc

Version 2.3 re-introduce the system-qt default: users can use their existing qt installation. If users need to use the offline qt installer they can
still do so by setting the environment variable QT_VERSION.

A docker image build on CentOS 7.5 using tag 2.3 is available, see data.jlab.org for details.

The complete set of supported libraries is:

banks ccdb clhep evio geant4 gemc jana mlibrary mysql qt root scons xercesc


Instructions for the JLab interactive nodes ifarm1401 or ifarm1402
------------------------------------------------------------------

To setup the environment and use tag 2.3:

Csh:

source /site/12gev_phys/softenv.csh 2.3

Bash:

source /site/12gev_phys/softenv.sh 2.3
