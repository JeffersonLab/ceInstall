Hi all,

Please find below the announcement for new release of the Scientific Computing Physics Libraries.
Sandy: could you send it out to the user community next Wednesday March 21?
I would appreciate feedback/comments/suggestions by or before that date.

New "softenv" scripts are available to setup the environment.
The "production" scripts will not be deleted but will no longer be maintained.

Please note:
 - The gcc and cmake version requirements/checks are no longer necessary as the JLAB CUE machines provide sufficient updated libraries by default.
 - The "development" tag may upgrade individual packages to newer versions as they are released.


Instructions:

To setup the environment to use tag 2.2:

Csh:

 source /site/12gev_phys/softenv.csh 2.2

Bash:

 source /site/12gev_phys/softenv.sh 2.2
