Hi all,

Please find below the announcement for new release of the Scientific Computing Physics Libraries.
Sandy: could you send it out to the user community by next Wednesday October 3, 2018?
I would appreciate feedback/comments/suggestions by or before that date.


JLab Physics Software Libraries Release Announcement
----------------------------------------------------

Production tag 2.3 of the JLab Physics Software Libraries will be available on October 3, 2018. It includes these updates:

- banks:        stays 1.4
- ccdb:         stays 1.06.02
- clhep:        2.3.4.5 > 2.4.0.4
- evio:         stays 5.1
- geant4:       4.10.03.p02 4.10.04.p02
- gemc:         2.6 > 2.7
- jana:         0.7.7p1 > 0.8.0
- mlibrary:     1.2 > 1.3
- qt:           5.9.1 to system defaults (currently 5.10.1 on most systems)
- root:         6.12.06 > 6.14.04
- scons build:  1.6 > 1.7
- xercesc:      stays 3.2.0

The "softenv" scripts are available to setup the environment, replacing the deprecated production scripts.

Version 2.3 comes with the possibility of selecting a subset of the supported libraries by
listing them in a ~/.jlab_software user file. For example, for geant4 only support, that file would read:

   clhep geant4 qt xercesc

Version 2.3 re-introduce the system-qt default: users can use their existing qt installation. If users need to use the offline qt installer they can
still do so by setting the environment variable QT_VERSION.

The complete set of supported libraries is:

banks ccdb clhep evio geant4 gemc jana mlibrary mysql qt root scons xercesc

Please note:
- The "development" tag may upgrade individual packages to newer versions as they are released.
