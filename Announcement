- banks:        1.3 > 1.4
- ccdb:         stays 1.06.02
- clhep:        2.3.4.3 > 2.3.4.5
- evio:         stays 5.1

- xercesc:      3.1.4 > 3.2.0

Starting from Wed, March 21 2018 new "softenv" scripts are available to setup the environment. They require the version number as argument.
The "production" scripts will not be deleted but will not be maintained anymore.

Additional notes:
 - The gcc and cmake versions requirements/checks are dropped from the scripts as the JLAB CUE machines
   (and any modern darwin/linux distributions) provide sufficient updated versions by default.
 - The development version of the libraries will upgrade each package to the latest release opportunistically.


Instructions:

To setup the environment to use 2.2:

Csh:

 source /site/12gev_phys/softenv.csh 2.2

Bash:

 source /site/12gev_phys/softenv.sh 2.2
