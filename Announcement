2.2 Announcement

A new version of the production JLab software libraries is available:

Version 2.2 includes these updates:

- scons build:  1.5 > 1.6
- banks:        1.3 > 1.4
- ccdb:         stays 1.06.02
- clhep:        2.3.4.3 > 2.3.4.5
- evio:         stays 5.1
- geant4:       4.10.02.p03 > 4.10.03.p02
- gemc:         2.6 > 2.7
- jana:         stays 0.7.7p1
- mlibrary:     1.1 > 1.2
- qt:           5.8.0 > 5.9.1
- root:         6.08.04 > 6.12.06
- xercesc:      3.1.4 > 3.2.0

Starting from Wed, March 21 2018 the "production" scripts can still be used, but they are replaced by "softenv" scripts, and require as argument the version number.
The renaming removes ambiguiries on what's production and what's development: all cases are specified by this mandatory argument.

This will ensure that:

- JLAB_VERSION release cycles will not modify user environments
- there's no ambiguity in the version number

Additional notes:
 - The gcc and cmake versions requirements are dropped from the scripts as the CUE machines
   (and modern darwin/linux distributions) provide sufficient updated versions by default.
 - Starting from 3/9/18 the release mechanism of ceInstall, mlibrary, scons build system, banks will be the git release mechanism.
 - The development version of the libraries will upgrade each package to the latest release.
   This will not happen all at once, and may happen more than once if a library is updated, so bewhare of using development.

To setup the environment to use 2.2:

Csh:

source /site/12gev_phys/production.csh 2.2

Bash:

source /site/12gev_phys/production.sh 2.2
