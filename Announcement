2.2 Announcement

Version 2.2 of the JLab software libraries will be available on March 21. It includes these updates:

- scons build:  1.5 > 1.6
- banks:        1.3 > 1.4
- ccdb:         stays 1.06.02
- clhep:        2.3.4.3 > 2.3.4.5
- evio:         stays 5.1
- geant4:       4.10.02.p03 > 4.10.03.p02
- gemc:         2.6 > 2.7
- jana:         stays 0.7.7p1
- mlibrary:     1.1 > 1.2
- qt:           5.8.0 > 5.9.1
- root:         6.08.04 > 6.12.06
- xercesc:      3.1.4 > 3.2.0

Starting from Wed, March 21 2018 the "production" scripts can still be used, but are replaced by "softenv" scripts, and require as argument the version number.
The renaming removes ambiguisies on what is "production" and what is "development": the tags are specified by the mandatory argument.

This will ensure that JLAB_VERSION release cycles will not modify user environments. Users will have to change the argument to update to the latest release.

Additional notes:
 - The gcc and cmake versions requirements/checks are dropped from the scripts as the CUE machines
   (and modern darwin/linux distributions) provide sufficient updated versions by default.
 - Starting from 3/9/18 the release mechanism of ceInstall, mlibrary, scons build system, banks are ported to the git release mechanism.
 - The development version of the libraries will upgrade each package to the latest release. This will not happen all at once, and may happen more than once if a library is updated, so bewhare of using development.

To setup the environment to use 2.2:

Csh:

source /site/12gev_phys/softenv.csh 2.2

Bash:

source /site/12gev_phys/softenv.sh 2.2
