The "production.csh" will require the version argument starting from Wed, July 5. This will ensure that:

- changes in JLAB_VERSION will not change libraries version underneath users
- there's no ambiguity in what a version users are running.

Details on what's in each version can be found here.

To setup the environment.

Csh:

source /site/12gev_phys/production.csh 2.1

Bash:

source /site/12gev_phys/production.sh 2.1
